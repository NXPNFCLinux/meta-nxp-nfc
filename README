OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer for NXP's NFC stack
============================================

This layer provides support for NXP's NFC NCI driver, user space lib,
and demo application.

The layer is SoC/CPU agnostic and can be used with any OpenEmbedded/Yocto
Project BSP, as long as the base layers provide board support for at least
the 4 NFC essential signals required by the NFC shields:

* I2C Clock from the processor
* I2C Data from the processor
* IRQ from the NFC board to the processor
* Enable signal from the processor to the NFC board

Dependencies
------------

This layer depends on:

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
branch: master
revision: HEAD

Testing
-------

The following environment, depicted in https://community.nxp.com/docs/DOC-343007,
has been used for development and tests:

Boards: 
* i.MX8Mmini evk (www.nxp.com/imx8mminievk)
* OM5578/PN7150RPIM (https://www.nxp.com/board/OM5578)
-- OM5578/PN7150RPIM must be slightly modified because some of the signals
required by PN7150 are not mapped to i.MX8Mmini evk expansion connector pins.

Software:
* i.MX Linux 4.14.78_1.0.0 BSP (https://www.nxp.com/imxsw)
* meta-nxp-nfc layer (https://github.com/NXPNFCLinux/meta-nxp-nfc)

To test the NFC stack integration, one can add the nxp-nfc-bin package to
any system image. The bin package is provided by the same recipe that provides
the nxp-nfc lib package, which in turn depends on the external kernel driver
module package, also part of this layer.

Once the system is up and running, the following command will poll for
NFC tags, and will print the content read from the NFC tag to the screen:

# nfcDemoApp poll

Notes
-----

This layer is the continuation of the work initiated by Rogerio Nunes (see 
https://github.com/rpnwoody/meta-nxp-nfc).

The SW stack enabled by this layer is custom implementation, non-compliant to
the mainstream Linux NFC Project.
